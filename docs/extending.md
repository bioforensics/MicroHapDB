# Adding Markers to MicroHapDB

> *I have some private microhap markers.
> Is it possible to include these in my MicroHapDB queries without making them public?*

Certainly!
See the `dbbuild/` directory for instructions on updating a private copy the database with additional sources of data.
This will require someone with bioinformatics experience to assist you.

> *I have published (or am getting ready to publish) a new panel of microhap markers and/or a set of population frequencies.
> Could you add these to MicroHapDB?*

Certainly!
The instructions in the `dbbuild/` directory describe what data files are required.
We would be happy to assist getting data into the correct format if that would helpâ€”just let us know by opening a thread on [MicroHapDB's issue tracker](https://github.com/bioforensics/MicroHapDB/issues/new).

> *My favorite data set of population-level genomic variation is not available in MicroHapDB.
> Could you add it?*

We would be happy to consider including any data set with compatible licensing or user agreements.
The `dbbuild/` directory describes the information required for marker and population definitions.
Computing allele frequencies from population data typically requires variant calls (VCFs) with phased genotypes for individuals.
Use [MicroHapDB's issue tracker](https://github.com/bioforensics/MicroHapDB/issues/new) to contact us with any questions about including new public data sets.
