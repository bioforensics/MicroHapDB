# MicroHapDB

**MicroHapDB** is a comprehensive catalog of human microhaplotype variation.
The database integrates marker and population frequency data from numerous published research articlesâ€”see [citations](citations.md).
Allele frequency estimates and allelic diversity statistics ($A_e$) are computed for 26 global populations so that markers can be ranked and evaluated for various applications.

MicroHapDB is managed as a community resource requiring minimal infrastructure to maintain: the entire contents of the database are distributed in plain text with each copy of MicroHapDB.
The primary interface to MicroHapDB is through the console command line, which provides methods for browsing, searching, and filtering the database contents.
Full programmatic access is available via a Python API.
Alternatively, users can access the database tables directly using a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel.
