# MicroHapDB

**MicroHapDB** is a comprehensive catalog of human microhaplotype variation.
The database integrates marker and population frequency data from numerous published research articlesâ€”see [citations](citations.md).
Allele frequency estimates and allelic diversity statistics ($A_e$) are computed for 26 global populations so that markers can be ranked and evaluated for various applications.

MicroHapDB is designed to be user-friendly for researchers, technology developers, and forensic practitioners, supporting a range of access methods from browsing and simple text queries to complex queries and full programmatic access via a Python API.
It is designed as a community resource requiring minimal infrastructure to use and maintain: the entire contents of the database are distributed in plain text with each copy of MicroHapDB.
