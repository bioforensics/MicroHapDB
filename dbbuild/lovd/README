├── locus-parse.py
│   Script used to process my manually-created microhap locus table and cross-
|   reference against dbSNP to pull out variant data needed for the main build
|   process.

├── lovd-allele-frequencies.txt
|   Plain-text representation of Sup. Table 2 from the paper at
|   https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsigen.2018.05.008.
|
├── lovd-microhap-loci.txt
|   Artisanal small-batch organic data table painstakingly hand-crafted from
|   microhap the alignments in mm1c.pdf. I will never get those hours of my life
|   back. I don't drink beer, but if I did, you should buy me one. NOTE: I left
|   out `mh17PK-86511` because the number of nested indels, SNPs, and alleles at
|   that locus is just ridonculous.

├── lovd-microhap-variants.tsv
|   Variants associated with the microhaps in the lovd-microhap-loci.txt table.
|
├── mmc1.pdf
|   Supplementary data file from https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsigen.2018.05.008.
|   Of course it's in PDF format instead of something easily machine readable.
