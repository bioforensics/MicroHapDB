│   │   In previous versions of the build process, it took +/- 20 minutes to
│   │   iterate through dbSNP to calculate the coordinates for each
│   │   microhaplotype locus. Although "best practice" dictates that these
│   │   values should be recomputed from scratch each time as part of the build,
│   │   I'm compromising here for a much quicker build time. Regardless, ALFRED
│   │   is at its end-of-life and it's very unlikely there will ever need to be
│   │   any changes to these values.

│   ├── indel-alleles.json
│   │   Insertion/deletion variants are annotated using I and D characters in
│   │   the ALFRED allele frequency table, rather than using the allele
│   │   sequence. This data file was created manually to provide convenient
│   │   access to the allele sequences.

│   └── microhaps-top-by-In.tsv
│       The microhaplotype score data here are "curated" in the sense that they
│       were never provided in a convenient machine-readable format by the
│       authors. It had to be copy-and-pasted from the article HTML and manually
│       re-formatted, which is always an error-prone process. In any case, the
│       data was never used in the build, and we opted instead to compute Ae
│       values directly from the allele frequency data. Recomputing the In
│       values requires individual-level genotype data which are not available.
